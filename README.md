# yuuOS - My hobby operating system
An operating system, made by me, in my programming journey. It's in its very early development stages.
Current status: barebones.

### Known stuff that goes on
Well, when you build it, it seems not to work. It's because the 32-bit (real-mode) text is printed in the (0, 0) position on the screen, overwriting any text at the top.
