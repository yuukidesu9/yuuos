# yuuOS - My operating system, I guess

Hey there! Welcome to my little hut in GitHub, where I host code and releases for my operating system, yuuOS.

The name choice it's quite obvious. I didn't want to put any fancy name on it, just a bit of my username.

### What is it?

It's a hobby operating system for x86 computers (x86_64 in the future, maybe) written in C.

It's still in its very early development stages, AKA, I'm toying around with it when I have spare time.

### Future goals (probably)

Some of these goals won't even be achieved, I think.

- Create user input routines.
- Create logging and debugging routines.
- Create file system management (namely FAT32, NTFS, ext2/3/4 and others).
- Create system utilities and integrate RTC from BIOS.
- Create drivers and kernel modules for audio, video (SVGA and beyond, with 16, 24 or 32-bit colors), networking and USB.
- Create GUI with font and image support.
- Create software and port a Python interpreter.
- Create environment for software portability from other operating systems.
